# Glossary of Terms

- **Bell state** – A maximally entangled two-qubit state. It behaves like a single unit even though it lives on two parties, so their measurement results stay perfectly coordinated.
- **Werner state** – A Bell state that has been mixed with uniform noise. The visibility parameter \(v\) sets how much of the original entanglement survives (1 is clean; 0 is pure noise).
- **Visibility \(v\)** – A number between 0 and 1 that tells you how strong the shared constraint is. High visibility means entanglement dominates; low visibility means noise dominates.
- **Measurement angle** – The direction (in the notebook, within the x–z plane) along which a qubit is projectively measured. Changing the angle changes the context and therefore the correlations you see.
- **CHSH inequality** – A test for non-classical correlations. Classical local models satisfy \(S \le 2\); entangled states can reach up to \(2\sqrt{2}\).
- **\(S\) value (CHSH statistic)** – The number computed in the CHSH test that summarises four correlation measurements. If it exceeds 2, you know the shared state is not explainable by local hidden variables.
- **Tsirelson bound** – The absolute quantum ceiling for the CHSH statistic: \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\). Quantum theory never predicts \(S\) larger than this.
- **No-signaling** – The requirement that one party’s marginal probabilities are independent of the other party’s measurement choice. In the notebooks this shows up as Alice’s marginals staying near 0.5 regardless of Bob’s angle (and vice versa).
- **Local hidden-variable (LHV) model** – A classical model where each particle carries pre-assigned answers for every measurement setting. Such models can never exceed \(S=2\).
- **Constraint** – The idea that the joint quantum state encodes a global rule linking both parties. Measurements reveal how the current apparatus taps into that rule.
